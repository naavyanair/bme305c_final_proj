To use the code, simply upload your image in the 'imread' function in the second line of the code. Run the code and scroll to the bottom to find your processed final image with the all cells boxed and a blue asterisk on the cells that are sickle shaped. 

*Note*
If the image is too big, it may need to be cropped in line 6 which changes the size of the crop rectangle.
